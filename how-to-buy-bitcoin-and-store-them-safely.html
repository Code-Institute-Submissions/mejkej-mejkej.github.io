         <h1>How to buy bitcoin and store them safely</h1>
         <h2>Storing your Bitcoin and why its very important</h2>
         <p>There is a famous saying in the crypto world, Not your keys not your crypto. 
            It has happend countless times that crypto exchanges got bankrupt and customers keeping their crypto
            on the exchange lost it all. When you keep your money in a normal bank account and something happend
            to the bank, your money is insured (up to a certain amount) Crypto exchanges usually doesnt have insurances
            like thgitat.
         <h2>The crypto wallet</h2>
         <p>There is alot of different crypto wallets, but i will only mention the one considered by most to be the best one.
            <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.ledger.com/?r=6a7d7f29b049"> The Ledger!</a> It is the safest wallet existing today and the one i personally use.
         </p>

         </div>
         <p>
            When setting up your wallet, you will
            get a key phrase of 24 words. These are your keys to your wallet. If you lose them, your crypto might be gone.
            If someone was to find the keys they could steal your crypto. So storing it safe somewhere preferably offline is super important.
         </p>
         <h2>Buying Bitcoin</h2>
         <p>To buy Bitcoin you register a account at a crypto exchange. There is alot of them but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bybit.com/register?affiliate_id=48327&group_id=0&group_type=1"> Bybit</a>
            is my favorit. And against my own advice i keep a part of my crypto holding on there using their amazing CopyTrade Function.
            You can either deposit euro or dollars on to the exchange and convert them to Bitcoin. This can be expensive and slow,
            depending on your native currency and what exchange you use. For me, the fastest and cheapest way to buy bitcoin is to buy it P2P
            (person to person) Bybit has a section called p2p, where you can both buy and sell crypto. The Exchange will hold the crypto until 
            the seller has been payed. So it is safe for both parties. I pay the person selling the crypto using<a target="_blank" href="https://wise.com/invite/u/marcusk490"> Wise.</a>
            Through them i can use my SEK to pay the seller in Euro and it only takes a couple minutes. Use my link for a free transfer of up to 500 Euro.
         </p>
         <h2>Another exchange in the crypto space is Nexo</h2>
         <p>Nexo has some seriously impressive interest rates, where you can earn as much as
            12% interest on your USDT (a crypto currency mirroring the value of the dollar)
            Borrow money with your crypto as collateral. They even have a Visa card available!
            They are also covered with an ensurance and are real time audited. They are pretty much
            a bank only much better! Create a account using this link<a target="_blank" href="https://nexo.io/ref/agptsg22qj?src=ios-link"> Nexo</a>
            deposit 100 dollars and you will get 25 dollars worth of Bitcoin.
