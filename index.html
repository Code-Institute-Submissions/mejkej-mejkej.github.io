         <h1>Why bitcoin is the best currency in the world</h1>
         <h2>Have you ever heard about inflation?</h2>
         <p>Inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services rise.
            Which can be translated as the decline of purchasing power over time.
            The cause of inflation is a increase in the supply of money.
            A country's money supply can be increased by its Authoritys. 
            Since bitcoin is a decentralized currency nobody can print more. There will 
            be a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin.

         <h2>Bank transfers vs Bitcoin transfer</h2>
         <p>It's not uncommon for a domestic wire transfer to cost $25 or $30. Sending money
            internationally can be even more expensive. Domestic banktransfers usually takes about 1 working day.
            A international banktransfer usually takes between 2-4 working day.
            Sending bitcoin to another person anywhere in the world usually takes between 20-60 minutes. No matter what day it is,
            the average price is 1-3 Dollars per transaction.
         </p>
         <h2>There are many reasons to get in to bitcoin</h2>
         <p>Crypto.comâ€™s market size report says the number of 
            cryptocurrency owners globally will reach one billion by the
            end of 2022, With bitcoin as the leader of the pack. That means
            About 10% of the world owns crypto today and that number is likely to 
            grow faster and faster.
