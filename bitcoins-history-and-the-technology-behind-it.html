         <h1>Bitcoins history and the technology behind it</h1>
         <h2>The birth of Bitcoin</h2>
         <p>The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October 2008,
            a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
            was posted to a cryptography mailing list. On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined
            the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text
            "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". This note references a headline published 
            by The Times and has been interpreted as both a timestamp and a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.
            Til this day the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is still unknown.

         <h2>The technology behind bitcoin</h2>
         <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system, meaning bitcoin does not have a central authority, such as a Bank
            in our usual economy. Instead it is built on a distributed digital record called a blockchain. The distributers of the digital record
            is called miners. When Mr A sends bitcoin to Mr B the transaction first goes to the miners their job is to make sure that everything
            is correct and when they are all in a agreement, The transaction gets uploaded as a new block on the blockchain. The blockchain is public
            and open for everybody to see. Anyone can become a miner aswell.
